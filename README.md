## Key Features Implementation

### ARC Smart Wallet
The wallet implementation uses ethers.js to interact directly with the ARC blockchain:
- **Real-time balance queries**: Fetches USDC balance from the ERC-20 contract
- **Transaction history**: Retrieves Transfer events from the blockchain
- **Transaction receipts**: Provides detailed receipt information including gas fees
- **Block explorer integration**: Links to testnet.arcscan.app for transaction verification
- **Account abstraction support**: Enhanced security and user experience features

### Stripe Identity Integration
KYC verification flow:
1. User initiates verification
2. System creates Stripe Identity session
3. User completes document verification
4. System receives webhook confirmation
5. Account is verified and full features unlocked

### Card Issuance
Card issuance process:
1. User completes KYC verification
2. User requests virtual or physical card
3. System creates Stripe cardholder
4. Card is issued with spending controls
5. User can start using the card immediately

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This is a demonstration application. For production use:

- Never expose private keys or mnemonics
- Implement proper key management (HSM, KMS)
- Use secure session management
- Implement rate limiting
- Add proper error handling
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement audit logging
- Add multi-factor authentication
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper CORS policies
